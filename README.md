This plug-in allows TeamCity builds to trigger deployments in Octopus Deploy. 

## Get the plugin

Download the plugin from [the Octopus Deploy downloads page](http://octopusdeploy.com/downloads) or the [JetBrains plugins downloads](<https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9038-octopus-deploy>).

Installation and usage instructions are available in [the Octopus Deploy documentation](http://octopusdeploy.com/documentation/integration/teamcity). 

## Building

To build the plugin from code:

 1. Install the latest version of the JDK
 2. Install TeamCity
 4. Run `mvnw -Dteamcity.distribution=C:\TeamCity clean package` (set the TeamCity
    directory to the location where you extracted or installed TeamCity locally). 
    The `mvnw` script will download Maven for you if it is not already installed.
 5. The plugin is available at `octopus-distribution/target/Octopus.TeamCity.zip`

## Editing and debugging in IntelliJ

1. Install TeamCity locally to `C:\TeamCity`. Allow the service to start for the first time, and add an 
   admin user. Then stop the service so it is not running.
2. Give yourself full permissions to the Teamcity Data folder (usually `C:\ProgramData\JetBrains\TeamCity`). 
   This folder may be hidden.
3. Import the Maven project into IntelliJ.
4. Create a Tomcat Configuration:
    1. Click Run -> Edit Configurations.
    2. Click the plus button and select Tomcat -> Local
       ![Run Configuration - Startup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OctopusDeploy/Octopus-TeamCity/master/TomcatLocal.PNG)
    3. Click the `Configure...` button next to the `Application Server:` option.
    4. Set the `Tomcat Home` option to the location of your TeamCity installation (probably `C:\TeamCity`).
        ![Run Configuration - Startup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OctopusDeploy/Octopus-TeamCity/master/TomcatServer.PNG)
    5. Click the `OK` button.
6. Under the `Startup/Connection` tab, set the `Startup script` to `C:\TeamCity\bin\teamcity-server.bat run` and 
   the `Shutdown script` to `C:\TeamCity\bin\teamcity-server.bat stop`. Do this for both the `Run` and `Debug` 
   environments.
5. Ensure that the `Before launch` list includes the step `Run Maven goal 'Octopus Deploy TeamCity plugin: package'`.
6. Run the `copy-plugin.cmd` script as an external tool after the Maven goal. This will copy the plugin to TeamCity.
6. Ignore the `Warning: No artifacts configured` message.
   ![Run Configuration - Startup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OctopusDeploy/Octopus-TeamCity/master/TomcatStartup.PNG)
7. Click the `OK` button to save your changes.

At this point the you can run TeamCity from IntelliJ. If need be you can run  TeamCity in debug mode and step 
through the plugin code as it is executed by TeamCity.

## Updating the version of Octopus CLI we embed

If the Octopus CLI has changed such that we need to update the version we embed with the plugin the steps are as follows:

- Locate the build in TeamCity and navigate to the Artifacts tab
- Expand the OctopusTools.Zips.*version*.zip file
- Download `octo.exe` from the OctopusTools.*version*.zip file. Also download the OctopusTools.*version*.portable.zip file
  ![Artifacts](artifacts.png)
- Rename the latter to `OctopusTools.portable.zip` and then copy them into the `\octopus-agent\src\main\resources\resources\3\0` folder, over the existing files

## Publishing a new version to the JetBrains Marketplace

_Currently we manually publish new versions of the TeamCity plugin directly in the JetBrains Marketplace due to the lack of support for specifying release notes as part of publishing via `cUrl` or `gradle`, once they've [added support for this](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/MP-2369) we will automate this part of the process._

1. Tag `master` with the next `major.minor.patch` version and wait for the tag to be built by TeamCity
2. Download the `Octopus.TeamCity.zip` artifact from the TeamCity Plugin build
    ![Download artifact from TeamCity](DownloadArtifact.png)
3. Login to the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9038-octopus-deploy-integration) using the "Jetbrains account" credentials from the password manager.
4. Click the `Edit` button in the top right corner
    ![Edit plugin](EditPlugin.png)
5. Choose the artifact that you downloaded from TeamCity
6. Leave the `Channel` as `Stable`
7. Enter the release notes for the version of the plugin that your creating. **Note:** The `Change Notes` field does not support `Markdown` it only supports `Html`.
8. Click `Upload new build` to publish the new version of the TeamCity plugin
